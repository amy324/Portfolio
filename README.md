## Demonstrative Projects/Microservices 

### Markdown to HTML Microservice
This is a microservice written in Golang that converts Markdown syntax to HTML. It provides a function `MarkdownToHTML` that takes Markdown content as input and returns the corresponding HTML content. The `main.go` file contains the logic for converting Markdown to HTML. It defines the `MarkdownToHTML` function, which takes Markdown content as input and uses regular expressions to identify and replace Markdown syntax with corresponding HTML tags. This includes handling headings, bold and italic text, unordered and ordered lists, links, and images.
Includes an example Markdown in `func main` - feel free to replace with any Markdown text to convert to HTML. Documentation provides expected terminal output.

### Fake Payment Gateway Microservice

The Fake Payment Gateway Microservice is a demonstration of card validation through a simple payment gateway, implemented in Golang. It allows users to submit payment information, including name, card number, payment amount, and currency, via HTTP requests. The server validates the credit card number using the Luhn algorithm and inserts the payment information into a PostgreSQL database. Clients can also retrieve invoice details using the payment ID.

**Key Features**:
- Card Validation: Utilizes the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers.
- Database Integration: Inserts payment information into a PostgreSQL database.
- HTTP Endpoints: Provides endpoints for submitting payment information and retrieving invoice details.
- Demonstrative Purposes: Intended for learning and demonstration, not for genuine payment processing.
