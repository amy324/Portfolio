## Demonstrative Projects/Microservices 

### Markdown to HTML Microservice
**Tech: Regex**

This is a microservice written in Golang that converts Markdown syntax to HTML. It provides a function `MarkdownToHTML` that takes Markdown content as input and returns the corresponding HTML content. The `main.go` file contains the logic for converting Markdown to HTML. It defines the `MarkdownToHTML` function, which takes Markdown content as input and uses regular expressions to identify and replace Markdown syntax with corresponding HTML tags. This includes handling headings, bold and italic text, unordered and ordered lists, links, and images.
Includes an example Markdown in `func main` - feel free to replace with any Markdown text to convert to HTML. Documentation provides expected terminal output.
